# Fuel Consumption Prediction using Machine Learning ‚õΩÔ∏è

This repository offers a thorough data science project aimed at estimating car fuel consumption with machine learning models.  The collection covers 2000 to 2022 and provides precise technical details for thousands of cars.  This research shows how feature engineering, model assessment, and hyperparameter tweaking may be utilized to develop reliable prediction models for sustainable transportation.
